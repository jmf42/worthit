  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Last updated: <strong>31 May 2025</strong></p>

  <h2>1.  Who we are</h2>
  <p><strong>WorthIt.ai</strong> is an educational tool that generates summaries and transcripts of publicly available YouTube videos.  We do not represent or work for YouTube or Google.</p>

  <h2>2.  Data we <em>do not</em> collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>No personal details (name, e-mail, Apple ID).</li>
    <li>No tracking cookies or advertising identifiers.</li>
    <li>No precise location data.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3.  Data we briefly process</h2>
  <p>When you request a transcript the app sends the <em>public video ID</em> to our server.  
     The server downloads the public captions, analyses them with OpenAI, and returns the summary.  
     We discard the transcript and analysis after 24 hours for cache-performance only.</p>

  <h2>4.  Analytics</h2>
  <p>Aggregate, anonymous usage counts (e.g.&nbsp;“how many summaries per day”) are stored to improve reliability.  
     No user-level profiles are kept.</p>

  <h2>5.  Processing with Artificial Intelligence</h2>
  <p>To generate summaries and analyses, we send the transcript and public comments to OpenAI.  
     This data is used solely for AI processing and is deleted according to the timelines described above.  
     OpenAI may store data in an aggregated or anonymized form to improve their models, but no personal user data is shared or retained by us.</p>

  <h2>6.  Retention of Data</h2>
  <p>Transcripts and comments are cached for up to 24 hours. Server logs containing IP addresses and request timestamps are retained for up to 30 days for operational diagnostics and security.</p>
  <p>• IP address, timestamp, and YouTube video ID are stored for ≤30 days for diagnostics; not linked to identity.</p>

  <h2>7.  Transfers to Third Countries</h2>
  <p>Transcripts and comments are processed in the United States via OpenAI servers. Although we do not send personal data, you acknowledge and consent to such transfer for service functionality.</p>

  <h2>8.  Your Privacy Rights</h2>
  <p>You have the right to access, correct, or request deletion of your data. To exercise these rights, contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@worthit.ai">privacy@worthit.ai</a>.</p>

  <h2>9.  Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Our services are not intended for children under the age of 13. If we learn that a child under 13 has submitted personal data, we will delete it promptly.</p>

  <h2>10.  Changes to this Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy. Changes will be posted here and indicated by an updated date at the top of the page.</p>
